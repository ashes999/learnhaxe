I created Learn Haxe to fill a void in Haxe learning. While Haxe sports excellent documentation (specifically, the API sections), a lot of good information lives on `old.haxe.org` or on the archived `nabble` forums. This confuses people.

I plan to post content on anything that isn't trivial to search out, or that lives primarily on out-dated websites. I also post lots of my own interesting experiments (such as my plugin architecture experiment).

Below, you can find an excellent lists of blogs to follow on various aspects of Haxe.

- [I Call Haxe!](http://player03.com/): Haxe and OpenFL
- [A Programming Devblog](http://coinflipstudios.com/devblog/): Haxe, OpenFL, and HaxeFlixel

I created Learn Haxe with [Butterfly](https://github.com/ashes999/butterfly). You can use Butterfly to create your own static-content blog. You can find the Learn Haxe source [on GitHub](https://github.com/ashes999/learnhaxe).
